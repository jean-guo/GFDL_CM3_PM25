# GFDL_CM3_PM25

Due to a lack of long term PM2.5 records, uncertainties in emissions, and complexities with aerosol chemistry, we currently lack a full understanding of how strongly aerosols can be expected to respond from year to year due solely to internal variability, independent of changing emissions.
I am using 400 years of a control run held at 2005 emissions levels from the GFDL CM3 model to see how much PM2.5 can be expected to change independent of emissions changes. 1) Read in net CDF files
2) Examine the control run
a. Monthly mean  

b. Standard deviation

c. Range

3) Comparison with RCP 8.5 scenario where emisions are held constant, but the aerosol precursors decline
